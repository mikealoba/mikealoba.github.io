												<h3>I'm Mike Angelo A. Aloba <br /> BS Mathematics and Science Teaching <br />Major in Physics</h3>

											<p>I was born and raised in Sariaya, Quezon Province. My special skills include basic Python Programming and HTML/CSS manipulations. My friends consider me studious as I spent most of my time in coding programs and reading academic texts, however I also have hobbies apart from academics like playing badminton and games of the generals.</p>

												<h3>Why the Teaching Profession?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>As early as my elementary years, I have been imitating my teachers' work like creating exams, answering forms and documents, checking quizzes and affixing cool signatures. Way back when I became a high school student, I loved tutoring others and speaking to other people. During my Senior High School years, I am lucky to have great teachers which influenced me a lot to become better individual which in turn made me realize that I want to imitate them. Simply put, I found the area of teaching to be a cool and a rewarding one especially when your students or your classmates approach you to say thank you for teaching them such knowledge that they never knew was possible, just the way I am influenced by my SHS mentors. </p>

												<h3>Why Physics?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The short answer is, I don't really know. Physics is really hard and I don't know why I am here. Probably because I found Physics curriculum to be interesting more than Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics. But who cares about majors in BS Mathematics and Science Teaching anyways, we are all taking heavy Maths and Sciences which speaks a lot about our learning contents. Kidding aside, I chose to major Physics because I find consolation in solving word problems and coming up with a significant answer. That is what should matter I believe, doing the things that make us happy even though it is hard sometimes.</p>
